# ClassRosterProject
C++ Project that demonstartes fundamental programming concepts, utilization of variables and data types,
implementation of control structures, arrays, pointers, functions, OOP, etc.

This program contains two classes (Student & Roster). This program maintains a current roster of students within a given course, student data,
student degree programs, etc. The porgram reads a list of students and uses function calls to manipulate the data. 
While parsing the list of data, the porgram creates student objects.
